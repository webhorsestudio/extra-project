-- FINAL ADMIN/USER/PUBLIC RLS CLEANUP MIGRATION (UUID CAST FIXED)
-- This migration removes all duplicate/conflicting policies and sets a single, clear policy per table.
-- It uses the is_admin() function for admin access, with proper uuid casting.

-- Create or replace the is_admin() function with uuid cast
