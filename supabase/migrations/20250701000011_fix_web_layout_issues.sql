-- Fix web layout issues: column names, RLS policies, and public access
-- This migration addresses the errors in the web layout

-- 1. Fix blogs table column reference issue
-- The code is trying to access 'main_image_url' but the column is 'featured_image'
-- Also fix the 'is_published' reference to 'status = published'

-- 2. Fix properties table relationship issue
-- The code is trying to join with 'bhk_configurations' but the table is 'property_configurations'

-- 3. Add missing public read policies for web layout

-- Enable RLS on all tables if not already enabled
